							(AND LAST) two opportunities we are going to have to make an

						</p>
						<p class="flex-item">
							In order to do this, we will have to free up our calendars
							<b>October 24th, 9am to 11am</b> (if not longer).
							The email has to be sent sometime before <b>October 22nd 11:00 AM.</b>

							Fill in the spots below, and email a request to speak
							(which ODOT is obliged to grant us two minutes each to do). 
						</p>
						<p class="flex-item">
							If you are unable to speak with ODOT, then ask them to put this

							Email Body

						<p class="flex-item">
							Please copy the below text, and then write a minimum of a couple
							of sentences explaining your dependency on 205. For example,
							<b>"I am obliged to take 3 to 4 trips a weekday across 205, which
								is $240 to $320 a month!"</b>
						</p>
						<p class="flex-item">
							The breakdown of the math above is:
							<br>
							One toll entry is $2.20 (

									drafted, subject to change
								</a>
							</em>
							).
							One toll exit is the same price.
							That is roughly $4 a trip (e.g. going to Costco from West Linn is a trip). 
							<br>
							If I take 3 trips a day per week, that is $12 a day, $60 a week, and $240 
							<br>
							If I take 4 trips a day per week, that is $16 a day, $80 a week, and $320

									Hello,
								</p>
								<p>
									My name is _______, and I am writing about tolling. 
								</p>
								<p>
									I am requesting time to speak October 24th with the Regional
									Toll Advisory Committee. I would like to discuss the impact
									tolling has on me. If my request is denied, take the
									following as comment for both the Committee's summary
									and meeting summary:
								</p>
								<p>
									The Equity and Mobility Committee, a volunteer ODOT group,
									has 15 members. Currently the only one listed near our area
									is Abe Molland, with Clackamas County Health and
									Transportation. The development of the tolling plan in 
									Clackamas County is grossly underrepresented. This is not equity.
								</p>
								<p>
									The ODOT Urban Mobility Office was formed a few years ago, with
									the current goals and priorities of "advancing equity, climate
									change, congestion relief, and safety goals."
									The effects of tolling West Linn do not align with your first
									priority, equity. The effects of tolling do not align with
									your third goal, congestion relief, as we will see increased
									congestion on our side roads.
								</p>
								<p>
									<b>&lt;Your subjective statement goes here&gt;</b>
								</p>
								<p>
									Please provide exemptions from West Linn for tolling.
								</p>

							I would suggest using a unique subject line, but focused around
