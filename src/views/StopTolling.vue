				<p class="flex-item">
					I am reaching out today to STOP TOLLING. And for us to make a serious
					attempt at this, I am organizing an event around the next
					(AND LAST) two opportunities we are going to have to make an
					impact on the tolling before finalizations begin to happen.
				</p>
				<p class="flex-item">
					In order to do this, we will have to free up our calendars
					<b>October 24th, 9am to 11am</b> (if not longer).
					The email has to be sent sometime before <b>October 22nd 11:00 AM.</b>
					<br>
				</p>
				<p class="flex-item">
					Fill in the spots below, and email a request to speak
					(which ODOT is obliged to grant us two minutes each to do). 
				</p>
				<p class="flex-item">
					If you are unable to speak with ODOT, then ask them to put this
					message in their meeting summary and message to the council, and
					remove the parts of the email asking to speak.
				</p>
				<h3 class="flex-item">
					Email Body
				</h3>
				<p class="flex-item">
					Please copy the below text, and then write a minimum of a couple
					of sentences explaining your dependency on 205. For example,
					<b>"I am obliged to take 3 to 4 trips a weekday across 205, which
						is $240 to $320 a month!"</b>
				</p>
				<p class="flex-item">
					The breakdown of the math above is:
					<br>
					One toll entry is $2.20 (
					<em>

							target="_blank"
						>
							drafted, subject to change
						</a>
					</em>
					).
					One toll exit is the same price.
					That is roughly $4 a trip. 
					<br>
					If I take 3 trips a week, that is $12 a day, $60 a week, and $240 
					<br>
					If I take 4 trips a week, that is $16 a day, $80 a week, and $320
					a month.

							Hello,
						</p>
						<p>
							My name is _______, and I am writing about tolling. 
						</p>
						<p>
							I am requesting time to speak October 24th with the Regional
							Toll Advisory Committee. I would like to discuss the impact
							tolling has on me. If my request is denied, take the
							following as comment for both the Committee's summary
							and meeting summary:
						</p>
						<p>
							The Equity and Mobility Committee, a volunteer ODOT group,
							has 15 members. Currently the only one listed near our area
							is Abe Molland, with Clackamas County Health and
							Transportation. The development of the tolling plan in 
							Clackamas County is grossly underrepresented. This is not equity.
						</p>
						<p>
							The ODOT Urban Mobility Office was formed a few years ago, with
							the current goals and priorities of "advancing equity, climate
							change, congestion relief, and safety goals."
							The effects of tolling West Linn do not align with your first
							priority, equity. The effects of tolling  do not align with
							your third goal, congestion relief, as we will see increased
							congestion on our side roads.
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>&lt;Your subjective statement goes here&gt;</b>
						</p>
						<p>
							Please provide exemptions from West Linn for tolling.
						</p>

					I would suggest using a unique subject line, but focused around
					"tolling". And by adding your own sentence, these emails and
